## Description

> Describe your application here and what it does

For this assignment you all will be going back to your last 3 assignments MarkDown Editor, Quiz, and Reactpardy, to make some big changes. You will be combining them all into a single application

Using a fresh clone of webpack-starter-with-tests

You app will have 4 routes
The / route will be a page welcoming users to the best Quiz/Jeopardy Clone/MarkDown Editor on the web.

The /game route will render the jeopardy game.

The /quiz route will render the quiz app.

The /editor route will render the markdown app.

You will not be moving over every file to this new project.

You will only want to copy over the components and actions from each assignment into this new project.

Your main focus should be on one assignment at a time.

Start with your most complete assignment.

Once that assignment is completely working in the new assignment. Move on to the next most complete assignment.

Keep in mind you will still have one reducer and one state for all 3 apps, so you'll need to carefully combine the actions and state of your previous apps one at a time.

Once all your old code is in the app and all 3 pages work the way they did previously, you will start to write tests.

There should be a minimum of 1 unit test per component.
There should be a minimum of 1 unit test per reducer action.
